# TorchlightGallery 🔦🎨

Welcome to **TorchlightGallery** – the app that lets you flip through random images like a fancy art critic while toggling your flashlight on and off for dramatic effect. Because who doesn’t need that? 😆

## 📸 Features
- **Random Image Roulette** 🎰: Each time you open the app, get surprised by a new random image. It’s like a box of chocolates, but for pictures. 🍫
- **Grayscale Makeover** 🎨: Tap to add that "classy black-and-white filter" to each image. Perfect for pretending you’re an art connoisseur.
- **Torchlight Power** 🔦: Feel the power of light in your hands! Tap the screen, and boom – flashlight on! Tap again, and poof – flashlight off! Now you’re a certified flashlight wizard. 🧙‍♂️

## 💡 How It Works
1. **Open the App** – A random image greets you. No need to thank us for the randomness, we know it’s exciting. 😉
2. **Tap the Screen** – Each tap does three magical things:
   - Changes the image to grayscale (or back to color) for that “I’m a photographer” vibe.
   - Toggles your phone’s flashlight, because… why not? 😆
   - Cycles to the next image in line. You’ll get to see every image eventually, even if it’s trying to play hard-to-get.

## 🛠️ Tech Stuff
- **Flutter** – The engine that drives this masterpiece. 🚀
- **TorchLight Plugin** – Because we need that flashlight drama. 🔦
- **Dart’s Randomizer** – Shuffling images for ultimate surprise (or chaos, as we like to call it). 🎲

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone this gallery of wonders:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yuslash/TorchlightGallery.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project:
   ```bash
   cd TorchlightGallery
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
4. Launch the app on your emulator or device:
   ```bash

   ```

## 📢 Warning
- This app may cause excessive tapping and random flashlight usage. Use at your own risk.
- Not responsible for any “battery drain” issues caused by excessive torch toggling. 😂

## ✨ Why This Exists
Because life is too short for boring apps. TorchlightGallery brings you the randomness you didn’t know you needed and gives your flashlight a reason to shine. If this app made you smile, we’ve done our job. 😜

Enjoy the gallery! 😆
